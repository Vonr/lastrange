# Lastrange

## A Lagrange Interpolator for string

Lastrange outputs a mathematical formula which given n, the position of the character,
gives back the character in the nth position of the originally encoded string
up to an untested precision.

This could perhaps be used in some strange obfuscation technique but was created for fun.
